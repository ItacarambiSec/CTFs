## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Access `http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org`, find the password for the next level, and use it to advance.

---

## 🔎 ANALYSIS

The page displays the message: “You can find the password for the next level on this page.”  
There are no visible forms or interactions.  
This suggests the password is hidden in the page itself.

---

## 🧱 STEPS

### Initial inspection

1. Accessed the page via browser.  
2. Used `Ctrl + U` to view the source code.

### Result

- The password was found inside an **HTML comment**.

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

- No tools were needed.  
- The challenge teaches the importance of inspecting HTML in web-based exercises.

---

## 🧪 COMMANDS USED

None — everything was done directly in the browser.

---

## 🧠 NOTES

Every Natas level contains the password for the next one.  
The goal is to find it by exploring vulnerabilities or oversights in the web application design.
