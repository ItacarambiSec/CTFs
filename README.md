# ðŸ§  CTF Write-ups and Practice Logs

This repository contains my Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, walkthroughs, and practice notes  
as I study offensive security, red teaming, and Linux-based exploitation.

Each subfolder corresponds to a platform or challenge set, such as:
- **OverTheWire** â€“ beginner Linux CTFs (e.g., Bandit)
- **TryHackMe** â€“ web, privilege escalation, enumeration labs
- **Hack The Box** â€“ intermediate/advanced machines and networks

All write-ups are for **educational purposes only** and follow the respective platforms' rules of engagement.

ðŸ“Œ I'm documenting my journey to learn and grow in cybersecurity,  
with a focus on **hands-on practice**, tool development, and ethical hacking.
